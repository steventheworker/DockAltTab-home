### The One and Only companion app for AltTab

### v2.91.0 download link https://github.com/steventheworker/DockAltTab/releases/download/v2.91.0/DockAltTab-v2.91.0.zip

##### OR ALTERNATIVELY,

-   compile this repository on Xcode

&nbsp;

# [NOTE](): For the time being, DockAltTab will only work with a [custom AltTab branch](https://github.com/steventheworker/alt-tab-macos/tree/scriptable) - maintained by steventheworker.

[Download here](https://github.com/steventheworker/alt-tab-macos/releases/download/1.91.0/DockAltTab.AltTab.v6.61.0.zip)

#### To resolve this: raise an issue on [the official repo](https://github.com/lwouis/alt-tab-macos/issues) / sending feedback via the AltTab app / by contacting [lwouis](https://github.com/lwouis/alt-tab-macos/) via the [AltTab discord server](https://discord.gg/CVEPeDufJa) (expressing interest in <u>[reopening this pull request](https://github.com/lwouis/alt-tab-macos/pull/1590#issuecomment-1131809994)</u> to add an AppleScript dictionary)

# Install Instructions:

-   Grant Accessibility & Input Monitoring permissions, it will then ask for Automation.
    -   After Input Monitoring is granted, if the downloads folder is on the dock, clicking it will also produce a prompt for Files & Folders permissions
-   NOTE: &nbsp; [AltTab](https://github.com/steventheworker/alt-tab-macos/releases/) must be running before launching
-   Optional: &nbsp; (**Firefox users** ONLY): &nbsp; to better ignore Picture-In-Picture windows, DockAltTab must also be granted "Screen Recording" permissions [(used to verify window title isn't "Picture-In-Picture")](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/126860#398314022); also helps filter out AltTab windows by title (otherwise click behavior glitches while AltTab preferences is open)
